In order to view testing results, you need to run the JUnit tests inside of the Testrix.java file.  
There are 50 tests, one for each method created inside of Matrix.java.  This was the most efficient
way for us to test our class, as doing this enables us to test each function with appropriate inputs.
The desired output was received in each case.  All 50 tests passed.
